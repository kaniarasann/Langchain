The company's revenue stood at Rs 1,025 crore, marginally lower than Rs 1,027 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.The performance also marked a sharp downturn from the previous quarter, when the company had posted a profit of Rs 19 crore. Sequentially, revenue fell 14% from Rs 1,197 crore in Q4FY25.The Aditya Birla Group company incurred expenses of Rs 1,042 crore in the quarter under review versus Rs 1,313 crore in Q4FY25 and Rs 1,190 crore in Q1FY25. The expenses were made under the heads including 'Cost of Materials consumed', freight & forwarding expense and power & fuel, among other things.The company achieved domestic sales volume of 2.18 MnT, up 11.6% YoY. The average capacity utilisation stood at 61% for the quarter.The Cement Realisations (net of logistics cost) improved by 5.7% QoQ.Live EventsThe company recorded total Ebitda/Mt of Rs 424, which improved significantly from Rs 88/Mt in Q4FY25.The average interest rate for Q1FY26 stood at 6.83%, declining by 110 bps QoQ.On a standalone basis, India Cements reported a net loss of Rs 14 crore in Q1FY26, narrowing from a loss of Rs 76 crore in Q4FY25 and compared to a net profit of Rs 57 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 5.5% year-on-year to Rs 1,025 crore from Rs 972 crore.During the quarter under review, the company approved the sale of its entire equity stake in its subsidiary, Industrial Chemicals & Monomers Ltd (ICML), for a total consideration of Rs 97.68 crore. As a result, the investment in ICML, previously carried at a cost of Rs 0.36 crore, has been reclassified as held for sale. The gain from this transaction will be recognised upon its completion, the company filing said.The company’s step-down subsidiary, PT Adcoal Energindo, Indonesia, approved the sale of its entire stake in PT Mitra Setia Tanah Bumbu, Indonesia, an associate entity, on July 3, 2025. The impact, if any, on the carrying value of the investment in the foreign subsidiary will be evaluated for impairment once the transaction is completed.The exceptional items for the quarter include two key impairments. First, an impairment of Rs 47.53 crore was recognised upon the consolidation of the subsidiary ICML, which has been classified as held for sale. This amount reflects the difference between the carrying value of ICML's net assets and their fair value less costs to sell. Second, an impairment of Rs 76.24 crore was recorded in relation to the proposed sale of a stake in MSTB, representing the gap between the carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) and its fair value less costs to sell.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.
